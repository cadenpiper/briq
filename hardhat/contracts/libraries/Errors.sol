/**
 * @title Errors
 * @author Briq Protocol
 * @notice Library containing all custom error definitions for the Briq Protocol
 * @dev This library centralizes all custom errors used throughout the protocol
 *      for consistent error handling and gas optimization. Custom errors are
 *      more gas-efficient than require statements with string messages.
 * 
 * Benefits:
 * - Gas optimization through custom errors
 * - Centralized error management
 * - Consistent error handling across contracts
 * - Better debugging and monitoring capabilities
