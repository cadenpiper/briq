/**
 * @title StrategyCompoundComet
 * @author Briq Protocol
 * @notice Strategy implementation for Compound V3 (Comet) lending protocol integration
 * @dev This contract implements the StrategyBase interface to provide yield generation
 *      through Compound V3 (Comet) lending markets. It handles token deposits, withdrawals,
 *      and balance tracking for supported base assets in Comet markets.
 * 
 * Key Features:
 * - Deposits base tokens into Compound V3 Comet markets to earn yield
 * - Supports multiple tokens through dynamic market configuration
 * - Handles withdrawals with automatic interest calculation
 * - Maps tokens to their corresponding Comet market contracts
 * 
 * Architecture:
 * - Integrates with Compound V3 Comet contracts for lending operations
 * - Maintains mapping of supported tokens to their Comet markets
 * - Implements StrategyBase interface for coordinator compatibility
 * 
 * Security Features:
 * - Coordinator-only access for deposit/withdraw operations
 * - Owner-only administrative functions
 * - ReentrancyGuard protection on state-changing functions
 * - SafeERC20 for secure token transfers
 * - Custom error handling for gas efficiency
