 * 
 * Key Features:
 * - Standardized interface for all strategy implementations
 * - Coordinator-only access control for core functions
 * - Abstract functions that must be implemented by derived contracts
 * 
 * Security Features:
 * - onlyCoordinator modifier for access control
 * - Abstract design prevents direct deployment
