 * @title IComet
 * @author Briq Protocol
 * @notice Interface for Compound V3 (Comet) lending protocol integration
 * @dev This interface defines the essential functions needed to interact with
 *      Compound V3 Comet markets for lending and borrowing operations. It provides
 *      a simplified interface focusing on the core functionality required by the
 *      Briq Protocol strategies.
 * 
 * Compound V3 Overview:
 * - Comet markets are isolated lending pools for specific base assets
 * - Each market has one base asset (e.g., USDC, WETH) that can be supplied/borrowed
 * - Suppliers earn interest on their base asset deposits
 * - Interest rates are determined algorithmically based on utilization
 * 
 * Integration Notes:
 * - Used by StrategyCompoundComet for yield generation
 * - Focuses on supply-side operations (lending) for yield
 * - Balances automatically accrue interest over time

     *      increases and begins accruing interest.

     * - Transfers tokens from caller to Comet
