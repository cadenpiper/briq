 * @title BriqShares
 * @author Briq Protocol
 * @notice ERC20 token representing ownership shares in the Briq yield optimization vault
 * @dev This contract implements a shares token that represents proportional ownership
 *      of the underlying assets in the BriqVault. Shares are minted when users deposit
 *      and burned when users withdraw, maintaining proportional ownership.
 * 
 * Key Features:
 * - Standard ERC20 functionality for transferability
 * - Mint/burn functionality restricted to the vault contract
 * - Ownership transfer to vault for operational control
 * 
 * Security Features:
 * - Only vault can mint/burn shares
 * - Owner-only vault address updates
 * - Standard ERC20 protections
